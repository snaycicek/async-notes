# Async Notes 📱
A simple **React Native application** that lets you add text via keyboard input, display it in a list, and persist the data on the device.

## 🚀 Features
- Accepts text input from the user.  
- Displays the entered data in a list on the screen.  
- Stores data persistently using **AsyncStorage** (data remains even after closing the app).  
- Clean single-page UI.  
- Modular code structure with custom components (e.g., `TextBox`, `ButtonBox`).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React Native  
- AsyncStorage (`@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`)  
- Custom Components
- Simple UI design with StyleSheet
